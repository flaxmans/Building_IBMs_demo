# Building Individual-Based Models Demonstration

This repository is meant to serve as a starting point for a demonstration/workshop on building individual-based models.  The example code is constructed in R since this is a common language used by biologists in the intended audience.

## Files you will find here:

* IBM_SourceFunctions.R: a file of functions that run the simulation.
* SimulationScript.R: a script meant to be run that makes use of the functions in the previous file and uses them to create one instance of a simulation run.

## Notes for users:
* SimulationScript.R contains the line `setwd("~/Building_IBMs_demo/")`.  Users should re-write this to make sense for their own path.
